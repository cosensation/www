co sensation refers to the integration of human sensation with technology.
The concept of co sensation suggests the idea of combining human senses and technological capabilities to create a more immersive and interactive user experience.
This integration could involve leveraging various sensory inputs to enhance human-computer interaction or creating interfaces that can provide realistic or augmented sensory feedback to users.

This could involve technologies like haptic feedback, virtual reality, augmented reality, or any other means of integrating sensory information into technological interfaces.

In the context of technology, a "haptic system" refers to a system or technology that incorporates the sense of touch or tactile feedback into human-computer interaction. It is commonly used to enhance virtual reality experiences, simulations, or remote operations. Haptic systems typically involve the use of specialized devices, such as haptic gloves or controllers, that can provide users with sensations of touch, vibrations, and forces to make virtual or remote interactions more immersive and realistic. These systems aim to create a sense of presence and enhance user engagement by simulating the tactile sensations that would be experienced in real-world interactions.
